# Appresize

Resize & move apps from anywhere on MacOS with customizable modifiers.

## Known Limitations

This app uses the macOS Accessibility APIs in order to discover windows and update their position and size. Some apps such as Telegram and Stream Deck create windows that don't participate in this mechanism and are invisible to this software.
